    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p> This is my first site. I always try to learn, not only webcoding but also programming in the past few weeks. <br> This article is updated: 2019.09.28. </p>
  <p> Next update: 2019.10.31. <br>
    This might also be a blog. In the last few weeks I've been progressing with Power BI since it is starting to be needed for my work. I learned that it also possible to use JavaScript etc. so I think I will really have to learn that too. <br>
    Not that I mind it.<br>
    I still find solving logical problems fun, not like solving real life problems. <br>
    Hey, if you're out there, send me a mail, just so I can know if anyone reads this. <br>
    If not, I will continue anyway. <br> <p>
