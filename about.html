<h1> Learning to code and stuff </h1>
<p>I created this page, so I can practice calmly during my boring workhours. I work as a Coordinator, and my job is very stressful, <br>
    this is why I decided on learning to code, and starting my own business one day. I know I have a lot to do still, but hey, we all <br>
    started somewhere. I am happy to accept help and tricks and tips from anyone who may have some free time, and advice to a nobie <br>
    like me. </p>
